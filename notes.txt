concerns:

* how to query listing schedule by date, correlated with bookings
	- perhaps we have direct relationship between schedule and booking
	- perhaps we just query by date range and correlate after-the-fact
* security and rules enforcement ... lots of server-side logic + enforcement needed here.
	- what prevents users from overbooking?
	- payment security
	- payment negotation
	- ensuring valid schedule data
	- some entities can only be created securly server-side (e.g., transactions)
* selective sync
	- would need to be able to sync just my reservations | listings | schedules
		- and related entities
	- would probably need to query listings LIVE ... else millions of constantly changing listings
* this model is like many models: many potential implicit M:M relationships
	- need to be able to traverse and query these efficiently and elegantly
